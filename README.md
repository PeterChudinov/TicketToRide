DONT YOU FUCKING DARE COMMITING INTO MASTER

DONT EVEN THINK OF TOUCHING MASTER

MAKE A BRANCH, COMMIT INTO IT AND MAKE A PULL REQUEST

WHEN MERGING A PULL REQUEST - SQUASH AND FUCKING MERGE

MAKE A NEW BRANCH FOR EACH NEW FEATURE, NAME ACCORDINGLY!

Every time you start working on this:
1. `git checkout master`
2. `git pull`
3. `git checkout <your_branch>`
4. `git rebase master`
