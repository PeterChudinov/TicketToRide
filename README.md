DONT YOU FUCKING DARE COMMITING INTO MASTER

DONT EVEN THINK OF TOUCHING MASTER

MAKE A BRANCH, COMMIT INTO IT AND MAKE A PULL REQUEST

WHEN MERGING A PULL REQUEST - SQUASH AND FUCKING MERGE

MAKE A NEW BRANCH FOR EACH NEW FEATURE, NAME ACCORDINGLY!

Every time you start working on this:
1. `git checkout master`
2. `git pull`
3. `git checkout <your_branch>`
4. `git rebase master`

Usefull git commands:
1. `git diff` - shows what you added since last commit + trailing whitespaces
2. `git stash` - removes unadded changes, helpfull when rebasing ugly shit (can pull them out later)
3. `git reset .` - resets your changes
4. `git branch` - shows current branch
5. `git status` - to see what's up with git
